1. a. How long did you spend on it? 
        About a full working day.
   b. How would you change the solution?
        I would add more search engines and allow the user to switch between them without having to restart 
        I would make it more interactive by allowing the user to maybe see more details from the results
        Add caching for repeat queries
        Make it more strongly typed
        
        I would definately comment the code more ...

        I would also def redo this solution and target iOS or Android.

2. For PHP I would say the creating classes based on Strings is quite handy, for instance how the handler, display_class and argument_rewriters are
   specified in the config.json.

3. I would use performance monitoring tools to try to track down bottlenecks, additionally peer reviews often help to spot mistakes or badly written code.
